*Recidivism scenario: Should a defendant be detained?*

* Anti-classification: Race and gender should not be considered for the decision at all
* Independence: Detention rates should be equal across gender and race groups
* Separation: Among defendants who would not have gone on to commit a
violent crime if released, detention rates are equal across gender and race groups

![](compas-metrics.png)

* ProPublica investigation: COMPAS violates separation w/ FPR & FNR
* Northpointe response: COMPAS is fair because it has similar FDRs
  across both races
  * FDR = FP / (FP + TP) = 1 - Precision
  * FPR = FP / (FP + TN)
* __Q. So is COMPAS both fair & unfair at the same time? Which definition
  is the "right" one?__

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Fairness Definitions: Pitfalls 

![](fairness-accuracy.jpeg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* Easy to pick some definition & claim that the model is fair
  * But is the __overall system__ actually fair?
  * What are the root causes of bias in the first place?
* In general, impossible to satisfy multiple fairness definitions at
once
	* Also consider trade-offs against accuracy & other system goals
* Fairness is a __context-dependent__ notion!
	* Select the criteria that minimize harm for the given context

</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Requirements Engineering for Fairness

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Recall: Machine vs World

![](machine-world.png)

* No ML/AI lives in vacuum; every system is deployed as part of the world
* A requirement describes a desired state of the world (i.e., environment)
* Machine (software) is _created_ to manipulate the environment into
this state

<!-- ---- -->
<!-- ## Requirements & Fairness -->

<!-- ![](machine-world.png) -->
<!-- <\!-- .element: class="stretch" -\-> -->

<!-- * Fairness is a __context-dependent__ notion -->
<!-- * __Again, think about requirements!__ -->
<!--   * Who are the stakeholders of the system? -->
<!-- 	* Which of these groups could be harmed? -->
<!--   * What potential harms can be caused by biased decisions? -->
<!-- 	* e.g., unfair punishments, denial to resources -->
<!--   * Are there any legal constraints or policy goals? -->
<!-- 	* e.g., 80% rule, affirmative actions  -->
<!--   * How are these decisions related to the ML model? Errors? -->
<!-- 	* e.g., false positives, false negatives -->
<!--   * Which fairness metric minimizes the harm? -->

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Requirements for Fair ML Systems

* Identify requirements (REQ) over the environment
	* What types of harm can be caused by biased decisions?
	* Who are stakeholders? Which population groups can be harmed?
	* Are we trying to achieve equality vs. equity? 
	* What are legal requirements to consider?
* Define the interface between the environment & machine (ML)
	* What data will be sensed/measured by AI? Potential biases?
	* What types of decisions will the system make? Punitive or assistive?
* Identify the environmental assumptions (ENV)
  * Adversarial? Misuse? Unfair (dis-)advantages?
  * Population distributions?
* Devise machine specifications (SPEC) that are sufficient to establish REQ
	* What type of fairness definition is appropriate?

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## "Four-fifth rule" (or "80% rule")

$(P[R = 1 | A = a]) / (P[R = 1 | A = b]) \geq 0.8$

* Selection rate for a protected group (e.g., $A = a$) <
80% of highest rate => selection procedure considered as having "adverse
impact"
* Guideline adopted by Federal agencies (Department of Justice, Equal
  Employment Opportunity Commission, etc.,) in 1978
* If violated, must justify business necessity (i.e., the selection procedure is
  essential to the safe & efficient operation)
* Example: Hiring
  * 50% of male applicants vs 20% female applicants hired
  (0.2/0.5 = 0.4)
  * Is there a business justification for hiring men at a higher rate?

![Contrasting equality, equity, and justice](eej2.jpeg)

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Type of Decision & Possible Harm

* If decision is _punitive_ in nature:
  * e.g. decide whom to deny bail based on risk of recidivism
  * Harm is caused when a protected group is given an unwarranted penalty
  * Heuristic: Use a fairness metric (separation) based on __false positive rate__
* If decision is _assistive_ in nature:
  * e.g., decide who should receive a loan or a food subsidy
  * Harm is caused when a group in need is incorrectly denied assistance
  * Heuristic: Use a fairness metric based on __false negative rate__

* Model: Use historical data to predict crime rates by neighborhoods

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Long-term Impact of ML

![](ml-cycle.png)

* ML systems make multiple decisions over time, influence the
behaviors of populations in the real world
* But most models are built & optimized assuming that the world is
static!
* Difficult to estimate the impact of ML over time
  * Need to reason about the system dynamics (world vs machine)
  * e.g., what's the effect of a loan lending policy on a population?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Long-term Impact & Fairness

![](fairness-longterm.png)
* Deploying an ML model with a fairness criterion does NOT guarantee
  improvement in equality over time
* Even if a model appears to promote fairness in
short term, it may result harm over a long-term period

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Monitoring & Auditing

* Continuously monitor for:
  - Match between training data, test data, and instances that you encounter in deployment
  - Fairness metrics: Is the system yielding fair results over time?
  - Population shifts: May suggest needs to adjust fairness metric/thresholds
  - User reports & complaints: Log and audit system decisions
    perceived to be unfair by users
* Deploy escalation plans: How do you respond when harm occurs due to

	* Shutdown system? Temporary replacement?
	* Maintain communication lines to stakeholders
* Invite diverse stakeholders to audit system for biases
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Monitoring & Auditing

* Think about system goals and relevant fairness concerns
* Analyze risks & harms to affected groups
* Understand environment interactions, attacks, and feedback loops (world vs machine)
* Influence data acquisition
* Define quality assurance procedures
  - separate test sets, automatic fairness measurement, testing in production
  - telemetry design and feedback mechanisms
  - incidence response plan

* Think critically before collecting any data
* Check for biases in data source selection process
* Try to identify societal biases present in data source
* Check for biases in cultural context of data source
* Check that data source matches deployment context
* Check for biases in
  * technology used to collect the data
  * humans involved in collecting data
  * sampling strategy
* *Ensure sufficient representation of subpopulations*
* Check that collection process itself is fair & ethical

*How can we achieve fairness without putting a tax on already disadvantaged populations?*
